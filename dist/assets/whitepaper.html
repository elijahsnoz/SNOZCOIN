    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>SNOZCOIN is a community-driven digital asset designed to align incentives between long-term holders, contributors, and the broader ecosystem. This document outlines the project's principles, governance approach, token design considerations, roadmap, and security practices. It is intended to be a living document — updated by the community as SNOZ grows.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> A resilient, community-owned digital asset that supports sustainable utility and real-world engagement.</p>
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Prioritize transparency, fair growth, and community participation to build long-term value and useful utility for $SNOZ holders.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many token projects prioritize short-term speculation over utility and community alignment. Lack of transparency, sudden token supply events, and centralized control reduce community trust.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Approach / Solution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Community governance and open decision-making.</li>
      <li>Transparent treasury reporting and periodic public updates.</li>
      <li>Focus on developing sustainable utility (governance tools, community rewards, and real partnerships).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Token Design (Guiding Principles)</h2>
    <p>We recommend designing token mechanics that emphasize alignment with long-term holders and contributors. Key considerations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear token purpose: utility, governance, and community incentives.</li>
      <li>Predictable supply rules: avoid unexpected inflation events without community approval.</li>
      <li>Vesting for team and partners to align incentives over time (details should be published openly).</li>
      <li>Liquidity management and treasury policies that are auditable and community-reviewed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Governance</h2>
    <p>Governance is community-first. Proposals affecting tokenomics, treasury spend, or protocol changes should be surfaced to the community, debated publicly, and decided via an agreed governance process (off-chain discussions with on-chain execution or formal voting depending on maturity).</p>

    <h2>Security & Audits</h2>
    <p>Security is a priority. We will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use established smart contract patterns and libraries.</li>
      <li>Publish contract source code and encourage third-party audits.</li>
      <li>Encourage bug bounties and community security reviews.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Transparency & Reporting</h2>
    <p>All treasury movements, audits, and major decisions will be published to the community. Regular updates should include finances, roadmap progress, and allocation changes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Community & Incentives</h2>
    <p>Community programs (bounties, grants, ambassador programs) will be developed to reward meaningful contributions. Governance participation and long-term holding should be incentivized through clear and fair mechanisms.</p>
